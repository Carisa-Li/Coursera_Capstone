Background

  Car accidents are a kind of accidents which can be from vital to insignificant. Thus, how to determine a car accident's severity as soon as possible is 
  important, since it is helpful to take countermeasures. As a result, I use the dataset which is about the collisions and try to predict the severity of 
  a car accident.


Problem

  Can we predict a car accident's severity?


Interest

  This model can help traffic police and hospital to decide next action or be prepared. For example, traffic police can evacuate traffic to let
  ambulances arrive sooner and save other drivers' time, while hospital can be well-prepared when occur vital car accident. What's more, when several car
  accidents happen in the same time, this model can help these people to allocate resources. Therefore, the injured can get better treatment and these 
  car accidents can have less impact on others.
